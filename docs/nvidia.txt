Nvidia Corporation[a] (/ɛnˈvɪdiə/ en-VID-ee-ə) is an American technology company headquartered in Santa Clara, California. Founded in 1993 by Jensen Huang, Chris Malachowsky, and Curtis Priem, it develops graphics processing units (GPUs), systems on chips (SoCs), and application programming interfaces (APIs) for data science, high-performance computing, and mobile and automotive applications.[5][6] Nvidia has been described as a Big Tech company.

Originally focused on GPUs for video gaming, Nvidia broadened their use into other markets, including artificial intelligence (AI), professional visualization, and supercomputing. The company's product lines include GeForce GPUs for gaming and creative workloads, and professional GPUs for edge computing, scientific research, and industrial applications. As of the first quarter of 2025, Nvidia held a 92% share of the discrete desktop and laptop GPU market.[7][8]

In the early 2000s, the company invested over a billion dollars to develop CUDA, a software platform and API that enabled GPUs to run massively parallel programs for a broad range of compute-intensive applications.[9][10][11] As a result, as of 2025, Nvidia controlled more than 80% of the market for GPUs used in training and deploying AI models,[9] and provided chips for over 75% of the world's TOP500 supercomputers.[1] The company has also expanded into gaming hardware and services, with products such as the Shield Portable, Shield Tablet, and Shield TV, and operates the GeForce Now cloud gaming service.[12] Furthermore, it has developed the Tegra line of mobile processors for smartphones, tablets, and automotive infotainment systems.[13][14][15]

In 2023, Nvidia became the seventh U.S. company to reach a US$1 trillion valuation.[16] It became the first company in the world to surpass US$4 trillion[17][18] and US$5 trillion[19] milestones in market capitalization in 2025, driven by rising global demand for data center hardware in the midst of the AI boom. For its strength, size and market capitalization, Nvidia has been selected to be one of Bloomberg's "Magnificent Seven", the seven biggest companies on the stock market in these regards.[20]

Nvidia was founded on April 5, 1993,[21][22][23] by Jensen Huang, a Taiwanese-American electrical engineer who was previously the director of CoreWare at LSI Logic and a microprocessor designer at AMD; Chris Malachowsky, an engineer who worked at Sun Microsystems; and Curtis Priem, who was previously a senior staff engineer and graphics chip designer at IBM and Sun Microsystems.[24][25] In late 1992, the three men agreed to start the company in a meeting at a Denny's roadside diner on Berryessa Road in East San Jose.[26][27][28][29]

At the time, Malachowsky and Priem were frustrated with Sun's management and were looking to leave, but Huang was on "firmer ground",[30] in that he was already running his own division at LSI.[27] The three co-founders discussed a vision of the future which was so compelling that Huang decided to leave LSI[30] and become the chief executive officer of their new startup.[27]

The three co-founders envisioned graphics-based processing as the best trajectory for tackling challenges that had eluded general-purpose computing methods.[30] As Huang later explained: "We also observed that video games were simultaneously one of the most computationally challenging problems and would have incredibly high sales volume. Those two conditions don't happen very often. Video games was our killer app — a flywheel to reach large markets funding huge R&D to solve massive computational problems."[30]

The first problem was who would quit first. Huang's wife, Lori, did not want him to resign from LSI unless Malachowsky resigned from Sun at the same time, and Malachowsky's wife, Melody, felt the same way about Huang.[31] Priem broke that deadlock by resigning first from Sun, effective December 31, 1992.[31] According to Priem, this put pressure on Huang and Malachowsky to not leave him to "flail alone", so they gave notice too.[32] Huang left LSI and "officially joined Priem on February 17", which was also Huang's 30th birthday, while Malachowsky left Sun in early March.[32] In early 1993, the three founders began working together on their new startup in Priem's townhouse in Fremont, California.[33]

With $40,000 in the bank, the company was born.[30] The company subsequently received $20 million of venture capital funding from Sequoia Capital, Sutter Hill Ventures, and others.[34]

During the late 1990s, Nvidia was one of 70 startup companies pursuing the idea that graphics acceleration for video games was the path to the future.[26] Only two survived: Nvidia and ATI Technologies, the latter of which merged into AMD.[26]

Nvidia initially had no name.[35] Priem's first idea was "Primal Graphics", a syllabic abbreviation of two of the founders' last names, but that left out Huang.[35] They soon discovered it was impossible to create a workable name with syllables from all three founders' names, after considering "Huaprimal", "Prihuamal", "Malluapri", etc.[35] The next idea came from Priem's idea for the name of Nvidia's first product.[35] Priem originally wanted to call it the "GXNV", as in the "next version" of the GX graphics chips which he had worked on at Sun.[33] Then Huang told Priem to "drop the GX", resulting in the name "NV".[33] Priem made a list of words with the letters "NV" in them.[35] At one point, Malachowsky and Priem wanted to call the company NVision, but that name was already taken by a manufacturer of toilet paper.[27] Both Priem[35] and Huang have taken credit for coming up with the name Nvidia,[27] from "invidia", the Latin word for "envy".[30]

After the company outgrew Priem's townhouse, its original headquarters office was in Sunnyvale, California.[30]

First graphics accelerator
Nvidia's first graphics accelerator, the NV1, was designed to process quadrilateral primitives (forward texture mapping), a feature that set it apart from competitors, who preferred triangle primitives.[27] However, when Microsoft introduced the DirectX platform, it chose not to support any other graphics software and announced that its Direct3D API would exclusively support triangles.[27][36] As a result, the NV1 failed to gain traction in the market.[37]

Nvidia had also entered into a partnership with Sega to supply the graphics chip for the Dreamcast console and worked on the project for about a year. However, Nvidia's technology was already lagging behind competitors. This placed the company in a difficult position: continue working on a chip that was likely doomed to fail or abandon the project, risking financial collapse.[38]

In a pivotal moment, Sega's president, Shoichiro Irimajiri, visited Huang in person to inform him that Sega had decided to choose another vendor for the Dreamcast. However, Irimajiri believed in Nvidia's potential and persuaded Sega's management to invest $5 million into the company. Huang later reflected that this funding was all that kept Nvidia afloat, and that Irimajiri's "understanding and generosity gave us six months to live".[38]

In 1996, Huang laid off more than half of Nvidia's employees—thereby reducing headcount from 100 to 40—and focused the company's remaining resources on developing a graphics accelerator product optimized for processing triangle primitives: the RIVA 128.[27][36] By the time the RIVA 128 was released in August 1997, Nvidia had only enough money left for one month's payroll.[27] The sense of impending failure became so pervasive that it gave rise to Nvidia's unofficial company motto: "Our company is thirty days from going out of business."[27] Huang began internal presentations to Nvidia staff with those words for many years.[27]

Nvidia sold about a million RIVA 128 units within four months,[27] and used the revenue to fund development of its next generation of products.[36] In 1998, the release of the RIVA TNT helped solidify Nvidia's reputation as a leader in graphics technology.[39]

Public company
Nvidia went public on January 22, 1999.[40][41][42] Investing in Nvidia after it had already failed to deliver on its contract turned out to be Irimajiri's best decision as Sega's president. After Irimajiri left Sega in 2000, Sega sold its Nvidia stock for $15 million.[38]

In late 1999, Nvidia released the GeForce 256 (NV10), its first product expressly marketed as a GPU, which was most notable for introducing onboard transformation and lighting (T&L) to consumer-level 3D hardware. Running at 120 MHz and featuring four-pixel pipelines, it implemented advanced video acceleration, motion compensation, and hardware sub-picture alpha blending. The GeForce outperformed existing products by a wide margin.

Because its products were performing well, Nvidia won the contract to develop the graphics hardware for Microsoft’s Xbox game console, which included a $200 million advance. However, the project took many of its best engineers away from other projects. In the short term this did not matter, and the GeForce 2 GTS shipped in the summer of 2000. In December 2000, Nvidia reached an agreement to acquire the intellectual assets of its one-time rival 3dfx, a pioneer in consumer 3D graphics technology leading the field from the mid-1990s until 2000.[43][44] The acquisition process was finalized in April 2002.[45]

In 2001, Standard & Poor's selected Nvidia to replace the departing Enron in the S&P 500 stock index, meaning that index funds would need to hold Nvidia shares going forward.[46]

In July 2002, Nvidia acquired Exluna for an undisclosed sum. Exluna made software-rendering tools and the personnel were merged into the Cg project.[47] In August 2003, Nvidia acquired MediaQ for approximately US$70 million.[48] It launched GoForce the following year. On April 22, 2004, Nvidia acquired iReady, also a provider of high-performance TCP offload engines and iSCSI controllers.[49] In December 2004, it was announced that Nvidia would assist Sony with the design of the graphics processor (RSX) for the PlayStation 3 game console. On December 14, 2005, Nvidia acquired ULI Electronics, which at the time supplied third-party southbridge parts for chipsets to ATI, Nvidia's competitor.[50] In March 2006, Nvidia acquired Hybrid Graphics.[51] In December 2006, Nvidia, along with its main rival in the graphics industry AMD (which had acquired ATI), received subpoenas from the U.S. Department of Justice regarding possible antitrust violations in the graphics card industry.[52]

2007–2014
Forbes named Nvidia its Company of the Year for 2007, citing the accomplishments it made during the said period as well as during the previous five years.[53] On January 5, 2007, Nvidia announced that it had completed the acquisition of PortalPlayer, Inc.[54] In February 2008, Nvidia acquired Ageia, developer of PhysX, a physics engine and physics processing unit. Nvidia announced that it planned to integrate the PhysX technology into its future GPU products.[55][56]

In July 2008, Nvidia took a write-down of approximately $200 million on its first-quarter revenue, after reporting that certain mobile chipsets and GPUs produced by the company had "abnormal failure rates" due to manufacturing defects. Nvidia, however, did not reveal the affected products. In September 2008, Nvidia became the subject of a class action lawsuit over the defects, claiming that the faulty GPUs had been incorporated into certain laptop models manufactured by Apple Inc., Dell, and HP. In September 2010, Nvidia reached a settlement, in which it would reimburse owners of the affected laptops for repairs or, in some cases, replacement.[57][58] On January 10, 2011, Nvidia signed a six-year, $1.5 billion cross-licensing agreement with Intel, ending all litigation between the two companies.[59]

In November 2011, after initially unveiling it at Mobile World Congress, Nvidia released its ARM-based system on a chip for mobile devices, Tegra 3. Nvidia claimed that the chip featured the first-ever quad-core mobile CPU.[60][61] In May 2011, it was announced that Nvidia had agreed to acquire Icera, a baseband chip making company in the UK, for $367 million.[62] In January 2013, Nvidia unveiled the Tegra 4, as well as the Nvidia Shield, an Android-based handheld game console powered by the new system on a chip.[63] On July 29, 2013, Nvidia announced that they acquired PGI from STMicroelectronics.[64]

In February 2013, Nvidia announced its plans to build a new headquarters in the form of two giant triangle-shaped buildings on the other side of San Tomas Expressway (to the west of its existing headquarters complex). The company selected triangles as its design theme. As Huang explained in a blog post, the triangle is "the fundamental building block of computer graphics".[65]

In 2014, Nvidia ported the Valve games Portal and Half Life 2 to its Nvidia Shield Tablet as Lightspeed Studio.[66][67] Since 2014, Nvidia has diversified its business focusing on three markets: gaming, automotive electronics, and mobile devices.[68]

That same year, Nvidia also prevailed in litigation brought by the trustee of 3dfx's bankruptcy estate to challenge its 2000 acquisition of 3dfx's intellectual assets. On November 6, 2014, in an unpublished memorandum order, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the "district court's judgment affirming the bankruptcy court's determination that [Nvidia] did not pay less than fair market value for assets purchased from 3dfx shortly before 3dfx filed for bankruptcy".[69]

2016–2018
On May 6, 2016, Nvidia unveiled the first GPUs of the GeForce 10 series, the GTX 1080 and 1070, based on the company's new Pascal microarchitecture. Nvidia claimed that both models outperformed its Maxwell-based Titan X model; the models incorporate GDDR5X and GDDR5 memory respectively, and use a 16 nm manufacturing process. The architecture also supports a new hardware feature known as simultaneous multi-projection (SMP), which is designed to improve the quality of multi-monitor and virtual reality (VR) rendering.[70][71][72] Laptops that include these GPUs and are sufficiently thin – as of late 2017, under 0.8 inches (20 mm) – have been designated as meeting Nvidia's "Max-Q" design standard.[73]

In July 2016, Nvidia agreed to a settlement for a false advertising lawsuit regarding its GTX 970 model, as the models were unable to use all of their advertised 4 GB of VRAM due to limitations brought by the design of its hardware.[74] In May 2017, Nvidia announced a partnership with Toyota which would use Nvidia's Drive PX-series artificial intelligence platform for its autonomous vehicles.[75] In July 2017, Nvidia and Chinese search giant Baidu announced a far-reaching AI partnership that includes cloud computing, autonomous driving, consumer devices, and Baidu's open-source AI framework PaddlePaddle. Baidu unveiled that Nvidia's Drive PX 2 AI will be the foundation of its autonomous-vehicle platform.[76]

Nvidia released the Titan V on December 7, 2017.[77][78]

Nvidia released the Nvidia Quadro GV100 on March 27, 2018.[79] Nvidia released the RTX 2080 GPUs on September 27, 2018. In 2018, Google announced that Nvidia's Tesla P4 graphic cards would be integrated into Google Cloud service's artificial intelligence.[80]

In May 2018, on the Nvidia user forum, a thread was started[81] asking the company to update users when they would release web drivers for its cards installed on legacy Mac Pro machines up to mid-2012 5,1 running the macOS Mojave operating system 10.14. Web drivers are required to enable graphics acceleration and multiple display monitor capabilities of the GPU. On its Mojave update info website, Apple stated that macOS Mojave would run on legacy machines with 'Metal compatible' graphics cards[82] and listed Metal compatible GPUs, including some manufactured by Nvidia.[83] However, this list did not include Metal compatible cards that currently work in macOS High Sierra using Nvidia-developed web drivers. In September, Nvidia responded, "Apple fully controls drivers for macOS. But if Apple allows, our engineers are ready and eager to help Apple deliver great drivers for macOS 10.14 (Mojave)."[84] In October, Nvidia followed this up with another public announcement, "Apple fully controls drivers for macOS. Unfortunately, Nvidia currently cannot release a driver unless it is approved by Apple,"[85] suggesting a possible rift between the two companies.[86] By January 2019, with still no sign of the enabling web drivers, Apple Insider weighed into the controversy with a claim that Apple management "doesn't want Nvidia support in macOS".[87] The following month, Apple Insider followed this up with another claim that Nvidia support was abandoned because of "relational issues in the past",[88] and that Apple was developing its own GPU technology.[89] Without Apple-approved Nvidia web drivers, Apple users are faced with replacing their Nvidia cards with a competing supported brand, such as AMD Radeon from the list recommended by Apple.[90]

On March 11, 2019, Nvidia announced a deal to buy Mellanox Technologies for $6.9 billion[91] to substantially expand its footprint in the high-performance computing market. In May 2019, Nvidia announced new RTX Studio laptops. The creators say that the new laptop is going to be seven times faster than a top-end MacBook Pro with a Core i9 and AMD's Radeon Pro Vega 20 graphics in apps like Maya and RedCine-X Pro.[92] In August 2019, Nvidia announced Minecraft RTX, an official Nvidia-developed patch for the game Minecraft adding real-time DXR ray tracing exclusively to the Windows 10 version of the game. The whole game is, in Nvidia's words, "refit" with path tracing, which dramatically affects the way light, reflections, and shadows work inside the engine.[93]

2020–2023
In May 2020, Nvidia announced it was acquiring Cumulus Networks.[94] Post acquisition the company was absorbed into Nvidia's networking business unit, along with Mellanox.

In May 2020, Nvidia developed an open-source ventilator to address the shortage resulting from the global coronavirus pandemic.[95] On May 14, 2020, Nvidia officially announced their Ampere GPU microarchitecture and the Nvidia A100 GPU accelerator.[96][97] In July 2020, it was reported that Nvidia was in talks with SoftBank to buy Arm, a UK-based chip designer, for $32 billion.[98]

On September 1, 2020, Nvidia officially announced the GeForce 30 series based on the company's new Ampere microarchitecture.[99][100]

On September 13, 2020, Nvidia announced that they would buy Arm from SoftBank Group for $40 billion, subject to the usual scrutiny, with the latter retaining a 10% share of Nvidia.[101][102][103][104]

In October 2020, Nvidia announced its plan to build the most powerful computer in Cambridge, England. The computer, called Cambridge-1, launched in July 2021 with a $100 million investment and will employ AI to support healthcare research.[105][106] According to Jensen Huang, "The Cambridge-1 supercomputer will serve as a hub of innovation for the UK, and further the groundbreaking work being done by the nation's researchers in critical healthcare and drug discovery."[107]

Also in October 2020, along with the release of the Nvidia RTX A6000, Nvidia announced it is retiring its workstation GPU brand Quadro, shifting its product name to Nvidia RTX for future products and the manufacturing to be Nvidia Ampere architecture-based.[108]

In August 2021, the proposed takeover of Arm was stalled after the UK's Competition and Markets Authority raised "significant competition concerns".[109] In October 2021, the European Commission opened a competition investigation into the takeover. The Commission stated that Nvidia's acquisition could restrict competitors' access to Arm's products and provide Nvidia with too much internal information on its competitors due to their deals with Arm. SoftBank (the parent company of Arm) and Nvidia announced in early February 2022 that they "had agreed not to move forward with the transaction 'because of significant regulatory challenges'".[110] The investigation was set to end on March 15, 2022.[111][112] That same month, Nvidia was reportedly compromised by a cyberattack.[113] This would have been the largest semiconductor acquisition in history.[17][18]

In March 2022, Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang mentioned that they were open to having Intel manufacture their chips in the future.[114] This was the first time the company mentioned that they would work together with Intel's upcoming foundry services.

In April 2022, it was reported that Nvidia planned to open a new research center in Yerevan, Armenia.[115]

In May 2022, Nvidia opened Voyager, the second of the two giant buildings at its new headquarters complex to the west of the old one. Unlike its smaller and older sibling Endeavor, the triangle theming is used more "sparingly" in Voyager.[116][117]

In September 2022, Nvidia announced its next-generation automotive-grade chip, Drive Thor.[118][119]

In September 2022, Nvidia announced a collaboration with the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard related to the entire suite of Nvidia's AI-powered healthcare software suite called Clara, that includes Parabricks and MONAI.[120]
